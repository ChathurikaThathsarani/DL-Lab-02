1) Accuracy changes as the number of hidden nodes increases. Can see an initial increase in accuracy with a moderate number of hidden nodes, followed by a slight decrease in accuracy as add more hidden nodes.

2) As the number of hidden nodes increases, the accuracy is likely to improve initially.
With more hidden nodes, the neural network can better capture nuances and finer details in the data set, leading to improved performance.
The accuracy may continue to increase or stabilize up to a certain point as increase the number of hidden nodes.
